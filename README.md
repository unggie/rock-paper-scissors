# Rock-Paper-Scissors

AA simple interactive **Rock, Paper, Scissors** game built using vanilla JavaScript. This game allows a human player to compete against the computer in 5 rounds using a text-based interface via `prompt()` and `console.log()`.

---

## ðŸŽ® How It Works

- The game plays **5 rounds** of Rock, Paper, Scissors.
- The human player selects a move using a numeric prompt:
  - `1` = Rock
  - `2` = Paper
  - `3` = Scissors
- The computer randomly selects a move.
- The result of each round is displayed in the console.
- Scores are tracked for both the player and computer.
- After 5 rounds, a final result is displayed:
  - Win
  - Loss
  - Draw

## ðŸ§  Game Logic

- Rock beats Scissors  
- Paper beats Rock  
- Scissors beats Paper  
- Same choice = Draw  

Each round compares the human's choice and the computer's choice using a `switch` and `if/else` based logic.
